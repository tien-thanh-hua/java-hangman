# java-hangman

Java implementation of Hangman game, for a school project


## Introduction

This is an "improved" version of the classic Hangman game, now with difficulty settings.

## Technologies

 - Java 8
 - JDK 1.8

## Setup

### Download

If you are new to GitHub (or any Version Control System in general), don't worry! It might look confusing, but we'll get there pretty quickly!

The simplest way to download is to go to the Releases page, then click on **Source code (zip)** for Windows users or **Source code (tar.gz)** for Linux users.
 
### Import

This project was built on NetBeans 8.2, so it is highly recommended to use it.

To import this project into your IDE, select File > Open Project, then select the folder containing all other folders (make sure to unzip your download file first!). If all goes well, your IDE should be showing all the project files in the navigator.

### Run

With the project imported, right click the project on **Projects** panel > **Run**. Wait a while for it to build the project, and it should run in a small window.

## Features

As this is a simple school project, the remake will copy most (if not all) of the original game's features, such as:

 - Basic gameplay: guess the hidden word's letters
 - Difficulty options before new games
	 - Easy: player starts with 9 lives, uses common words
	 - Normal: player starts with 6 lives, uses common words
	 - Hard: player starts with 6 lives, uses harder words
	 - Asian: only for the worthy
 - Scoring functionalities, with top 5 high scores saving supported
 - Basic UI for game information display
 - Loading data from preexisting files

If we still have any interest in this project after the university subject ends, maybe some cool features like achievements, time trials, boss battles could be implemented in the future (who knows!)
